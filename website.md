There are tons of ways to make a professional website ranging from nocode to writing the HTML yourself. The two important parts of a website are the design/content/code and the hosting. Some website builders like Wix and Squarespace offer both the design and hosting in one package. Other website builders like WordPress and Jekyll require you to host the website yourself. Github Pages is a free hosting service that is popular for hosting websites built with Jekyll but will also serve HTML sites. Here are some resources to help you get started.

### Nocode website builders:
- [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)
- [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)
- [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/)
- [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
- [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com/)
- [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/)
- [Mozilla Solo](https://soloist.ai/)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/build-a-website-with-notion-in-seconds-no-coding-required)


### Website builders with some code:
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) allows you to write your website in markdown (and then, when the page is built, it converts everything to HTML). It is built on a ruby back end but you don't need ruby to use it with GitHub pages.

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)


### Writing your own HTML:

- [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Github Pages:
If you put HTML files or a Jekyll site in a repository on Github, you can host it for free using Github Pages. To make a website for your account, name the repository `<your github id>.github.io` and for a website associated with an already existing repository (e.g. for code documentation) create a branch named `gh-pages` and put the website there. Here are some resources to help you get started:
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Jekyll on Github Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)

### Analytics:
A powerful tool of hosting your own website is the ability to use analytics to track who is visiting your site. Most templates have a way to insert a google analytics tag. Here are some resources to help you get started:
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) (see who visits your site)
- [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) (for WordPress)
- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) (see how your site is indexed by google)

# Personal website templates and examples
## Sam Factor

- I use Jekyll and host my website on github. The template I use for my personal website (and for the site you are currently on) is [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/). Here is my website in action: [https://smfactor.github.io](https://smfactor.github.io) and the actual code: [https://github.com/smfactor/smfactor.github.io](https://github.com/smfactor/smfactor.github.io).


## Joohyun Lee
- I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/) to make [my website](https://joohyun-lee.github.io/about/) and it's hosted on github ([github repo](https://github.com/Joohyun-Lee/joohyun-lee.github.io)).


## Jenna Samuel
- I have used [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) templates and hosted my website on github pages for a while now. The [website is here](https://jsamu.github.io/) and the [code is here](https://github.com/jsamu/jsamu.github.io). I'm going to explore non-coding website builders now though, specifically [Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/build-a-website-with-notion-in-seconds-no-coding-required).
